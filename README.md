About Me

Hello,

  I am a software developer based out of Detroit, MI. I currently work for Sea Sight Systems in Trenton, MI. They build and design software and hardware systems utilized in the dredging industry. Our main software product is called ClamVision. I worked on getting their CalcHMI software ready for customer use since a third-party hired before I joined did not complete the app according to Sea Sight's specifications. I also was the main lead for a mobile app built in Xamarin that surveyors will use to read data coming from a GPS rover. The app displays latitude and longitude coordinates, and computes X and Y projections based on the geoid model the user chooses. The app also computes the orthometric and ellipsoidal heights of the rover's location as well. I also added a function called Tilt Compensation that allows surveyors to quickly plot points using the rover on a pole without having them orient the pole perfectly vertically.
